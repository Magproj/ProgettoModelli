About
--------

[MyClientBase][1] is a simple, intuitive, free and open source web based invoice management system developed with freelancers in mind.

MyClientBase is designed to manage your clients and invoices as simply as possible without sacrificing powerful features that make a great application. Every feature included is aimed to benefit every user - not just one or two (in other words, you won't find any feature creep or software bloat here). Many of the features you'll find in MyClientBase are suggested directly by the community. Those suggestions that benefit the community as a whole are what makes MyClientBase the successful project that it is.
