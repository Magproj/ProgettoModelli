# Design rules to enforce

https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html#buttons-style
- buttons should be capitalized (this is automatically done)
- buttons should be on right (end) side

Empty lists should contain a central message with a big light grey icon above, as  you can see on gmail.
