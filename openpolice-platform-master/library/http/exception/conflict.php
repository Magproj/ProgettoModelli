/**
 * Conflict Http Exception
 *
 * The write request (PUT, POST, DELETE) has been rejected due conflicting changes made by another client, either to the
 * target resource itself or to a related resource. The server cannot currently complete the request without risking data
 * loss. The client should retry the request after accounting for any changes introduced by other clients.
 *
 * This response may include a Retry-After header indicating the time at which the conflicting edits are expected to
 * complete. Clients should wait until at least this time before retrying the request.
